      "I obtained my master’s degree in English and Dutch linguistics and literature from Ghent University in 2020. Since then, I have worked on projects involving language, identity, and media, and have taught at both undergraduate and graduate levels. In 2022, I began my PhD at Ghent University, investigating the stylistic use of African American English by blues performers. More recently, I have expanded my research interests to include computational linguistics, machine learning, and natural language processing. Alongside completing my PhD, I am currently pursuing a master’s in Statistical Data Analysis, with a focus on deep learning and natural language processing."
